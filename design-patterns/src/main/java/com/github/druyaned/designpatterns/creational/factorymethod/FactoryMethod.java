/**
 * Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
 * but also allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
 * 
 * <P><i>Usage</i><br>
 * The LogisticApp (client, this class) works with some {@link Logistics} classes (creators).
 * They in turn can create a new {@link Transport} (product) or return an existing one.
 * The client treats all the products and creators as abstractions that is good.
 * 
 * <P><i>Applicability</i><ul>
 *  <li>Use the Factory Method when you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and
 *      dependencies of the objects your code should work with.</li>
 *  <li>Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or
 *      framework with a way to extend its internal components.</li>
 *  <li>Use the Factory Method when you want to save system resources by
 *      reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time.</li>
 * </ul>
