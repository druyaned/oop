 * The Base Decorator class has a field for referencing a wrapped object.
 * The fieldâ€™s type should be declared as the component interface so
 * it can contain both concrete components and decorators.
 * The base decorator delegates all operations to the wrapped object.
 * 
 * <P>Concrete decorators must call methods on the wrapped object,
 * but may add something of their own to the result. Decorators
 * can execute the added behavior either before or after the call
 * to a wrapped object.
