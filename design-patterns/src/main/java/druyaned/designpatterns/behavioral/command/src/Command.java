/**
 * The Command interface usually declares just a single method for executing the command.
 * 
 * <P>Concrete Commands implement various kinds of requests. A concrete command
 * isnâ€™t supposed to perform the work on its own, but rather to pass the call to one
 * of the business logic objects. However, for the sake of simplifying the code,
 * these classes can be merged.
 * 
 * <P>Parameters required to execute a method on a receiving object can be declared
 * as fields in the concrete command. You can make command objects immutable by only
 * allowing the initialization of these fields via the constructor.
